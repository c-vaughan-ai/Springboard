##The goal of this Capstone project is to examine the relationship between unemployment and variables 
#such as race, gender, and age. (Over time) The research questions this project intends to answer is 
#how has the differences in the unemployment rate between demographics changed over time as well as 
#where are they expected to go in the future?

##The results of this project will provide useful information to policymakers and employers. The 
#unemployment rate is a key indicator used by policymakers to measure the strength of the economy 
#and when unemployment falls below potential real GDP also falls. If policymakers can focus on specific 
#groups of people who tend to be unemployed disproportionally, they can have a more significant impact on 
#the economy when it enters a recession. Policymakers in the past have created some programs to support 
#groups of people who tend to be unemployed at a higher rate than the general population, such as 
#minorities, so it will be interesting to see how the relationship between race and unemployment has 
#changed over time. Another insight this project may provide is to see if certain groups are affected by 
#recessions (ex. 2007-2009) more than others. If so, policymakers can focus on these groups more to help 
#get the economy out of a recession. 

##To investigate this question, I will use data collected by the US Bureau of Labor statistics dating 
#back to 1972. Organizing and cleaning this data will involve merging the various datasets and extracting 
#the variables I intend to use, race, gender, age, and unemployment rate. After the data has been wrangled,
#I will examine each variable individually as well as the relationship between different variables. 
#Then I will create a forecasting model that aims to predict the future values of unemployment rates 
#for different groups of interest. I can make these results available for policymakers so that they can 
#better understand unemployment rates and its future projection.
